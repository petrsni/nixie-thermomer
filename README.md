# nixie-thermometer
This is a simple  thermometer using Arduino uno, 3 nixie tubes (digitrons), fixed decimal point and a DS18B20 temperature sensor. Supported temperature range is 0.0 to 99.9 degrees Celsius (I only have 3 nixie tubes and no minus sign:) ). Tubes are multiplexed and connected to a single 74141 driver.
